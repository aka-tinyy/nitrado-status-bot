Nitrado Status Bot


I am not going to put directions on how to run because its sort of self explanitory. Just fill in spots that say serverid, servername, nitradotoken, and bot token. If you do run into any issues make a issue in the issues tab! This is fully working as I have tested it, there is no error handling for the api.
